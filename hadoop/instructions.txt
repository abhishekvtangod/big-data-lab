1. "export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64/"
2. Use bin/hadoop from hadoop folder, to verify the correct version "bin/hadoop --version".
3. Get the class path of the hadoop, using command "bin/hadoop classpath"
4. export this classpath, 
   "export CLASSPATH=paste_the_classpath_here"
5. After adding both the classpaths, the written Java files should be compiled and the generated classfiles should are used to create JAR file along with Manifest.
6. Go to the folder with source code, and compile all the Java files using:
   "javac -d . *.java"
7. Create Manifest.txt, with the text "Main-Class: package.main_class"
8. Bundling into JAR:
   "jar cfm abc.jar Manifest.txt Folder"
9. Run:
   "~/Downloads/hadoop-3.2.2/bin/hadoop jar abc.jar input.csv output"
